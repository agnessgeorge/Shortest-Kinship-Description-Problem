# Updates from version 1
# added a new parameter on the edges for the  "edge label", so every edge has four parameters (starting vertex, ....

# .
# added a function that returns the label of the shortest weighted path
# .
# added a test at the end to check whether the obtained path is inside a defined set of strings, the set contains
# strings made from the available labels in the graph
